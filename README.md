# Textbook Assistant

This repository contains code for a Textbook Assistant, designed to assist with retrieving information from academic sources and answering questions related to various topics.

## Overview

The Textbook Assistant is built using Python and leverages several libraries and tools for natural language processing and document retrieval. Here's an overview of what you'll find in this repository:

- **Notebook**: The `textbookAssistant.ipynb` notebook contains the code for the Textbook Assistant. It includes setup instructions, library installations, and code for interacting with different APIs and models.
  
- **Dependencies**: The notebook relies on several Python libraries, including `langchain`, `langchain_openai`, `arxiv`, and `torch`. You can find the installation commands in the notebook.

- **Functionality**: The Textbook Assistant is capable of retrieving academic documents from Arxiv, processing natural language queries, and providing relevant answers based on the input.

## Usage

To use the Textbook Assistant, follow these steps:

1. Open the `textbookAssistant.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to set up the environment and load the required libraries.
3. Execute the code cells to interact with the Textbook Assistant. You can input natural language queries and receive answers based on the implemented models and APIs.

## Getting Started
